# Welcome

When designing this website, I knew I couldn't simply dive back into relearning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nor was I interested in using pre-existing templates. So I focused on experimenting with the latest trend in automated coding. To bring my designs to life. For this website, I utilized ChatGPT-4 and Bard AI, to transform my ideas into reality.
